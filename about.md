*Lowell High School*
Hi, I’m Kat, and I’m ~~passionate~~ hyped about doing, enabling, and communicating interdisciplinary STEM activities. I’m the founder of Science & Us, an event that teaches high schoolers how to communicate complex ideas in exciting, clear ways through multimedia. I’ve completed research internships at Harvard University and UMass Lowell, and presented my projects in computational biology and biotechnology at the National Junior Science and Humanities Symposium, Massachusetts State Science and Engineering Fair, and the Journal of Emerging Investigators. I’m a member of FIRST Robotics Competition Team 5962, president of several clubs at Lowell High School in Lowell, MA, and recipient of the NCWIT Aspirations in Computing award. In my free time, I’m probably doing yoga and pushups in random places and/or looking at cat gifs. My goal is to bring the uniquely entrepreneurial mission of MAHacks to life and provide an exceptional, fun experience to all our participants, organizers, and sponsors.

*Medford High School*
Hi! I’m Emily, a student from Medford High School. Inclusion has always been important to me, and through MAHacks I hope to reach out to high school students looking for support, and to provide resources to help develop their passions in entrepreneurship and STEM. Outside of organizing MAHacks I’m the co-captain of Medford High’s robotics team 0547, chief editor of the printed Mustang News, president of the recently founded Center for Citizenship and Social Responsibility, founder and director of Medford’s annual Diversity Week, and a pianist with past concerto performances in Boston University. Whenever I have free time I enjoy taking walks in the Fells Reservation near my school, watching National Geographic documentaries (I <3 penguins), or jamming out to some Rachmaninoff or old Coldplay. ~~One of my goals~~ my only goal in life is to make a documentary about squirrels.
