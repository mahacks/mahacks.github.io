## What Makes MAHacks Different

Most hackathons are for college students or professionals. MAHacks strives to expand these platforms to youth by welcoming high school students of all backgrounds in Massachusetts and beyond. Too often, however, we see projects of little use being generated at hackathons, or projects being promptly abandoned. To combat this, MAHacks features Tracks and invites industry leaders to present students with real-world problems. Through this, participants are able to tackle specific issues, and can continue their projects through our opportunities for mentorship, accelerators, and experiential learning.
