## What Makes MAHacks Different

Most hackathons are for college students or professionals. MAHacks strives to expand these platforms to youth by welcoming high school students of all backgrounds in Massachusetts and beyond. Too often, however, we see projects of little use being generated at hackathons, or projects being promptly abandoned. To combat this, MAHacks features Tracks and invites industry leaders to present students with real-world problems. Through this, participants are able to tackle specific issues, and can continue their projects through our opportunities for mentorship, accelerators, and experiential learning.

## Meet the Team

### Katherine Huang

Co-Director 2018-19, Organizer 2017-18

Lowell High School ‘19

Hi, I’m Kat, and I’m passionate about doing, enabling, and communicating interdisciplinary STEM activities. My goal is to bring the uniquely entrepreneurial mission of MAHacks to life and provide an exceptional, fun experience to all our participants, organizers, and sponsors. I’ve also founded [Science & Us](www.scienceandus.org), an event that teaches high schoolers how to communicate complex ideas in exciting, clear ways through multimedia. I’m a captain of FIRST Robotics Competition Team 5962, president of several clubs at Lowell High School in Lowell, MA, and recipient of the NCWIT Aspirations in Computing award. In my free time, I’m probably doing yoga and pushups in random places and/or looking at cat gifs. 

### Emily Tan

Medford High School ‘19

Hi! I’m Emily, a senior at Medford High School. Inclusion has always been important to me, and through MAHacks I aim to build a supportive community of peers and mentors that continues to encourage each other _beyond our events_. Outside of organizing MAHacks I’m involved in various school activities as captain of Botball Team 0547, chief editor of the printed Mustang News, founder/director of Medford’s annual Diversity Week, and president of the [CCSR](www.medfordccsr.org). I also play piano and double bass! (pretty funny with me being 4'10¾") Whenever I have luxurious free time I enjoy power napping or hiking in the Middlesex Fells :D 

### Walter Shen

Belmont High School ‘19

Hi! I’m a senior at Belmont High School. I absolutely love math (especially statistics!) and science, and I’m a captain of my school’s Math Team and an active member of Science Team. I think hackathons are extremely great ways for people to enjoy STEM, and I hope to continue spreading that love with MAHacks! When I’m not poking the buttons of my graphing calculator, I enjoy reading Wikipedia articles and singing in choir. Violin is cool too! **And I really like ducks!**

### Aadhya Puttur

Chelmsford High School ‘19

Hey fans, I am Aadhya and I love to dab. I’m a senior at Chelmsford High School and I am passionate about computer science and entrepreneurship. I am a Girls Who Code alumna and have done research about relativity and **black holes** at MIT. I am very involved in my school as I am Co-captain of the Math Team, Founder and President of Coding Team, and Vice President of Science Team. Outside of STEM, I play first violin for Chelmsford Symphony Orchestra and the pit orchestra for my school’s annual musical. I also like to write short sci fi stories for fun and have my own blog for them. I am excited to be part of an organization that encourages STEM. I also **really really hate ☆starfishes☆**, because they are the most nastiest creatures to ever exist.

I play the trumpet in the Choate Jazz Band and Orchestra, and I am a co-president of the Choate Programming Union and a co-Vice President of the Physics Club. That aside, I also cox for the men’s crew team at Choate. I am thrilled to have the opportunity to share my love for STEM. As per protocol, I am required to say that my spirit animal is a koala.

I’m a senior at Choate Rosemary Hall and am unbelievably passionate about the intersectionality of activism and STEM. I’m a co-president of Choate Programming Union and Choate Diversity Student Association. I also am an AI4ALL alumni and an NCWIT Aspirations in Computing National Award Winner. In addition, my favorite areas of Computer Science are Natural Language Processing and Bioinformatics. If I could solve any international issue, I would solve climate change, women’s healthcare, or educational access. In my free time, I enjoy playing guitar, singing, wakeboarding, skiing, and musical theatre.  I am so excited to be an organizer for MAHacks because I want to make STEM more accessible to high school students everywhere!

I am a junior at Andover High School. MAHacks was the first hackathon I ever did and I learned so much about STEM and how to use my knowledge to make something that can positively impact the world. I want to allow other high school students to reach their full potential and I am the Executive Vice President of Andover Robotics Club, mentor a First Lego League robotics team, and participate in Girls Who Code. Outside of STEM, I am a Global Scholar at Andover High School, play violin and enjoy doing calligraphy(fancy cursive). My favorite animal is a unicorn (don’t you dare tell me they’re not real) and occasionally dress up as a unicorn. I am excited to be a part of MAHacks and encourage other high school students to become interested in the field of STEM!
