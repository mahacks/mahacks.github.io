## What Makes MAHacks Different

Most hackathons are for college students or professionals. MAHacks strives to expand these platforms to youth by welcoming high school students of all backgrounds in Massachusetts and beyond. Too often, however, we see projects of little use being generated at hackathons, or projects being promptly abandoned. To combat this, MAHacks features Tracks and invites industry leaders to present students with real-world problems. Through this, participants are able to tackle specific issues, and can continue their projects through our opportunities for mentorship, accelerators, and experiential learning.

## Meet the Team

### Katherine Huang

Co-Director 2018-9, Organizer 2017-8

Lowell High School ‘19

Hi, I’m Kat, and I’m passionate hyped about doing, enabling, and communicating interdisciplinary STEM activities. I’m the founder of [Science & Us](www.scienceandus.org), an event that teaches high schoolers how to communicate complex ideas in exciting, clear ways through multimedia. I’ve completed research internships at Harvard University and UMass Lowell, and presented my projects in computational biology and biotechnology at the National Junior Science and Humanities Symposium, Massachusetts State Science and Engineering Fair, and the Journal of Emerging Investigators. I’m a member of FIRST Robotics Competition Team 5962, president of several clubs at Lowell High School in Lowell, MA, and recipient of the NCWIT Aspirations in Computing award. In my free time, I’m probably doing yoga and pushups in random places and/or looking at cat gifs. My goal is to bring the uniquely entrepreneurial mission of MAHacks to life and provide an exceptional, fun experience to all our participants, organizers, and sponsors.

Co-Director 2018-9, Organizer 2017-8

Medford High School ‘19

Hi! I’m Emily, a senior at Medford High School. Inclusion has always been important to me, and through MAHacks I hope to reach out to high school students by building a network of peers and mentors to help develop their passions in entrepreneurship/STEM. I'm also an organizer for Science & Us alongside our co-director Kat :D Outside of organizing MAHacks and S&U I’m very involved in school organizations/activities (go Mustangs!) such as being co-captain of Medford High’s robotics team 0547, chief editor of the printed Mustang News, president of the CCSR, and director of Medford’s annual Diversity Week. I’ve also been a pianist for 13 years (concertos at Boston University whoo!), and double bassist - a struggle with me being 4’ 10¾” xD. Whenever I have free time I enjoy taking walks in the Fells Reservation near my school, watching National Geographic documentaries (I <3 penguins), or jamming out to some Rachmaninoff, old Coldplay, or Death Grips if I’m grinding through an English essay. ~~One of my goals~~ my only goal in life is to make a documentary about ~~pandas~~ ~~chipmunks~~ squirrels [¯\_(ツ)_/¯]() ❤

Organizer 2018-9

Belmont High School ‘19

Hi! I’m a junior at Belmont High School. I absolutely love math (especially statistics!) and science, and I’m a captain of my school’s Math Team and an active member of Science Team. I think hackathons are an extremely great way for people to enjoy STEM, and I hope to continue spreading that love with MAHacks! When I’m not poking the buttons of my graphing calculator, I enjoy reading Wikipedia articles and singing in choir. Violin is cool too.
**And I really like ducks!**

### Aadhya Puttur

Organizer 2018-9

Chelmsford High School ‘19

Hey fans, I am Aadhya and I love to dab. I’m a junior at Chelmsford High School and I am passionate about computer science and entrepreneurship. I am a Girls Who Code alumna and have done research about relativity and **black holes** at MIT. I am very involved in my school as I am Co-captain of the Math Team, Founder and President of Coding Team, and Vice President of Science Team. I also work in Kumon 9 hours a week where I tutor students from k -12 in math and english. Outside of STEM, I play first violin for Chelmsford Symphony Orchestra and the pit orchestra for my school’s annual musical. I also like to write short sci fi stories for fun and have my own blog for them. I've entered them in my cultural event, New England Kannada Koota, and have earned 1st place all four years. I am excited to be part of an organization that encourages STEM. I also really really hate ☆starfishes☆, because they are the most nastiest creatures to ever exist.

### Zhi Wei Gan

Choate Rosemary Hall ‘19

I’m a junior currently attending Choate Rosemary Hall from Malaysia. Since coming to the US, hackathons have been an incredible learning and bonding experience, and I hope to share the fun that I have had hacking through MAHacks. I play the trumpet in the Choate Jazz Band and Orchestra, and I am a co-president of the Choate Programming Union and a co-Vice President of the Physics Club. That aside, I also cox for the men’s crew team at Choate. I am thrilled to have the opportunity to share my love for STEM. As per protocol, I am required to say that my spirit animal is a koala.

### Rebekah Agwunobi 

Organizer 2017-8

Choate Rosemary Hall ‘19

I’m a junior at Choate Rosemary Hall and am unbelievably passionate about the intersectionality of activism and STEM. I’m a co-president of Choate Programming Union and Choate Diversity Student Association. I also am an AI4ALL alumni and an NCWIT Aspirations in Computing National Award Winner. In addition, my favorite areas of Computer Science are Natural Language Processing and Bioinformatics. If I could solve any international issue, I would solve climate change, women’s healthcare, or educational access. In my free time, I enjoy playing guitar, singing, wakeboarding, skiing, and musical theatre.  I am so excited to be an organizer for MAHacks because I want to make STEM more accessible to high school students everywhere! 

### Jolene Pern

Andover High School ‘20

I am a sophomore at Andover High School. MAHacks was the first hackathon I ever did and I learned so much about STEM and how to use my knowledge to make something that can positively impact the world. I want to allow other high school students to reach their full potential and I am the Executive Vice President of Andover Robotics Club, mentor a First Lego League robotics team, and participate in Girls Who Code. Outside of STEM, I am a Global Scholar at Andover High School, play violin and enjoy doing calligraphy(fancy cursive). My favorite animal is a unicorn (don’t you dare tell me they’re not real) and occasionally dress up as a unicorn. I am excited to be a part of MAHacks and encourage other high school students to become interested in the field of STEM!

### Nina Zhang

Hey guys! My name is Nina and I’m a junior at Winchester High School. I’m extremely passionate about STEM and entrepreneurship, as I’m an officer of the Winchester Science Olympiad, and an active member of the Winchester Robotics Team (Winchester B781-7otball…thanks KIPR). Additionally, I’m part of the Winchester High School Tennis Team and during my free time, I enjoy watching Youtube, playing video games, and surfing through instagram. My favorite animal is the orca because they’re so adorable and ahhhh…they’re just really cute.
