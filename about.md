### Katherine Huang

*Co-Director 2018-2019*

*Organizer 2017-2018*

*Lowell High School*

Hi, I’m Kat, and I’m ~~passionate~~ hyped about doing, enabling, and communicating interdisciplinary STEM activities. I’m the founder of Science & Us, an event that teaches high schoolers how to communicate complex ideas in exciting, clear ways through multimedia. I’ve completed research internships at Harvard University and UMass Lowell, and presented my projects in computational biology and biotechnology at the National Junior Science and Humanities Symposium, Massachusetts State Science and Engineering Fair, and the Journal of Emerging Investigators. I’m a member of FIRST Robotics Competition Team 5962, president of several clubs at Lowell High School in Lowell, MA, and recipient of the NCWIT Aspirations in Computing award. In my free time, I’m probably doing yoga and pushups in random places and/or looking at cat gifs. My goal is to bring the uniquely entrepreneurial mission of MAHacks to life and provide an exceptional, fun experience to all our participants, organizers, and sponsors.

### Emily Tan

*Co-Director 2018-2019*

*Organizer 2017-2018*

*Medford High School*

Hi! I’m Emily, a student from Medford High School. Inclusion has always been important to me, and through MAHacks I hope to reach out to high school students looking for support, and to provide resources to help develop their passions in entrepreneurship and STEM. Outside of organizing MAHacks I’m the co-captain of Medford High’s robotics team 0547, chief editor of the printed Mustang News, president of the recently founded Center for Citizenship and Social Responsibility, founder and director of Medford’s annual Diversity Week, and a pianist with past concerto performances in Boston University. Whenever I have free time I enjoy taking walks in the Fells Reservation near my school, watching National Geographic documentaries (I <3 penguins), or jamming out to some Rachmaninoff or old Coldplay. ~~One of my goals~~ my only goal in life is to make a documentary about squirrels.

### Rebekah Agwunobi 

*Organizer 2018-2019*

*Choate Rosemary Hall*

I’m a junior at Choate Rosemary Hall and am unbelievably passionate about the intersectionality of activism and STEM. I’m a co-president of Choate Programming Union and Choate Diversity Student Association. I also am an AI4ALL alumni and an NCWIT Aspirations in Computing National Award Winner. In addition, my favorite areas of Computer Science are Natural Language Processing and Bioinformatics. If I could solve any international issue, I would solve climate change, women’s healthcare, or educational access. In my free time, I enjoy playing guitar, singing, wakeboarding, skiing, and musical theatre.  I am so excited to be an organizer for MAHacks because I want to make STEM more accessible to high school students everywhere! 

### Aadhya Puttur

*Organizer 2018-2019*

*Chelmsford High School*

Hey fans, I am Aadhya and I love to dab. I’m a junior at Chelmsford High School and I am passionate about computer science and entrepreneurship. I am a Girls Who Code alumna and have done research about relativity and black holes at MIT. I am very involved in my school as I am Co-captain of the Math Team, Founder and President of Coding Team, and Vice President of Science Team. I also work in Kumon 9 hours a week where I tutor students from k -12 in math and english. Outside of STEM, I play first violin for Chelmsford Symphony Orchestra and the pit orchestra for my school’s annual musical. I also like to write short sci fi stories for fun and have my own blog for them. I ‘ve entered them in my cultural event, New England Kannada Koota, and have earned 1st place all four years. I am excited to be part of an organization that encourages STEM. I also really really hate ☆starfishes☆, because they are the most nastiest creatures to ever exist.

### Zhi Wei Gan

*Organizer 2018-2019*

*Choate Rosemary Hall*

I’m a junior currently attending Choate Rosemary Hall from Malaysia. Since coming to the US, hackathons have been an incredible learning and bonding experience, and I hope to share the fun that I have had hacking through MAHacks. I play the trumpet in the Choate Jazz Band and Orchestra, and I am a co-president of the Choate Programming Union and a co-Vice President of the Physics Club. That aside, I also cox for the men’s crew team at Choate. I am thrilled to have the opportunity to share my love for STEM. As per protocol, I am required to say that my spirit animal is a koala.

### Walter Shen

*Organizer 2018-2019*

*Belmont High School*

Hi! I’m a junior at Belmont High School. I absolutely love math (especially statistics!) and science, and I’m an active member of my school’s Math Team and Science Team. I think hackathons are an extremely great way for people to enjoy STEM, and I hope to continue spreading that love with MAHacks! When I’m not poking the buttons of my graphing calculator, I enjoy reading Wikipedia articles and singing in choir. Violin is cool too. And I really like ducks! 

### Jolene Pern

*Organizer 2018-2019*

*Andover High School*

I am a sophomore at Andover High School. MAHacks was the first hackathon I ever did and I learned so much about STEM and how to use my knowledge to make something that can positively impact the world. I want to allow other high school students to reach their full potential and I am captain of the all-girls First Tech Challenge robotics team in Andover, mentor a First Lego League robotics team, and participate in Girls Who Code. Outside of STEM, I am a Global Scholar at Andover High School, play violin and enjoy doing calligraphy(fancy cursive). My favorite animal is a unicorn (don’t you dare tell me they’re not real) and occasionally dress up as a unicorn.

### Nina Zhang

*Organizer 2018-2019*

*Winchester High School*

I’m a sophomore at Winchester High School and I’m extremely passionate about STEM activities and entrepreneurship. I’m an active member of the Winchester Science Olympiad and Robotics (Botball) team, and on weekends, I attend Youth CITIES, an entrepreneurship bootcamp. In addition, I’m part of the Winchester Tennis Team and enjoy doing activities such as gaming and Netflix. My favorite animal is the orca because they’re so adorable and nice. I’m extremely excited to be a part of this team that motivates and supports people interested in STEM. Hedgehogs are also cute.
