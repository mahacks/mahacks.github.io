					<h1>FAQ</h1>

					<p><i>The quintessential part of any hackathon's homepage.</i></p>
				</div>
				<div class="question-grid">
					<div>
						<h3>What the heck is a hackathon?</h3>
						<p>A hackathon is a fun event where students work together to brainstorm, code, design, and present projects, such as apps, websites, and hardware. At MAHacks, you can expand your skills, make new friends, and create something valuable!</p>
					</div>
					
					<div>
						<h3>Can I go to MAHacks?</h3>
						<p>High schoolers from any school, including homeschool, are welcome! Middle school students are allowed on a case-by-case basis, reach out to us at <a href="mailto:info@mahacks.com">info@mahacks.com</a>. <b>Unfortunately, we cannot allow parents or teacher chaperones at the event.</b></p>
					</div>
					
					<div>
						<h3>How much will it cost?</h3>
						<p>Nothing. Period. There will be workshops, prizes, swag, food, and fun, all at zero cost to you!</p>
					</div>

					<div>
						<h3>How do teams work?</h3>
						<p>Teams are made of 2-4 members and can submit a project as a group. If you don't have a team, don't worry! We'll have a team formation session to help you find other people to work with.</p>
					</div>

					<div>
						<h3>What if I've never coded before?</h3>
						<p>We’ll have workshops to teach anyone the basics of coding, but it’s not required. Teams often need designers, artists, writers, and anyone who can contribute. Most teams benefit from non-programmers!</p>
					</div>

					<div>
						<h3>I don’t have an idea!</h3>
						<p>Most people come to hackathons with no idea what they’re going to do, and that’s totally fine. We’ll be demoing many company APIs and hardware, and you can work with their products!</p>
					</div>

					<div>
						<h3>Are there travel reimbursements?</h3>
						<p>Unfortunately, we cannot reimburse participants’ travel expense at this time. :/ However, feel free to contact us at <a href="mailto:info@mahacks.com">info@mahacks.com</a> for travel advice.</p>
					</div>

					<div>
						<h3>What should I bring?</h3>
						<p>You need something to hack with (like your laptop) and its charger. For an overnight event, don't forget toiletries, a pillow, and a blanket. And most importantly, bring a willingness to learn and have fun!</p>
					</div>

					<div>
						<h3>What's the event schedule?</h3>
						<p>MAHacks V will be on October 26-27th 2019. We'll release a detailed schedule, including workshops and special activities, soon!</p>
					</div>

					<div>
						<h3>I'm a college student/professional interested in getting involved. How can I mentor?</h3>
						<p>Mentors can be college students and professionals skilled in software, mobile, or hardware development, graphic design, marketing, project management, or any area useful for hackathon participants. Mentors are free to work with multiple teams and guide them through issues, technical or otherwise, they're facing.</p>
					</div>

					<div>
						<h3>How can I sponsor?</h3>
						<p>Companies and organizations are welcome to provide monetary support for MAHacks. We also connect participants to mentors (e.g. office tours, chats with professional developers), accelerators/incubators (e.g. Boston Children's Hospital Accelerator), and learning opportunities (e.g. MIT Beaver Works Summer Institute). Reach out at <a href="mailto:info@mahacks.com">info@mahacks.com</a> and we'll be happy to learn about your organization and discuss further.</p>
					</div>
					<div>
						<h3>What if I have another question?</h3>
						<p>Feel free to email us at <a href="mailto:info@mahacks.com">info@mahacks.com</a>, and we’ll get back to you as soon as possible!</p>
